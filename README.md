# Demo React App.

Built to provide a quick, simple demonstration of using data-[prefix]-\* attributes to identify areas of content to be tracked in GTM. Using data attributes as the main hooks for GTM triggers and tags helps reduce tight coupling betwerern HTML structures, class names, IDs and GTM configuration.

## Setup

- Clone The Repo
- Open `gtm_config.json` and replace `GTM-XXXXXXX` with your GTM tracking id
- install dependancies with `npm i`
- Start the app with `npm start`
- Fire up your analytics dashboard and start poking around
